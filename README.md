# Boson-protocol-exchange

Boson Protocol is advancing the world of commerce by enabling enterprises, organisations, and customers to bridge the divide between digital decentralized technologies and the transfer and trade of physical goods. Our vision is for Boson to become the basic plumbing for dCommerce and its data on the emerging decentralized web, where the value captured is distributed equitably between token holders and protected from capture by a single centralized entity.

# Tools used for the implementation of the MVP

- Web3 1.0: Provides a JavaScript API for Ethereum blockchains by implementing the Ethereum JSON RPC API; it allows frontend web applications to interact with blockchains.
- Ganache: Ethereum blockchain JavaScript implementation which runs in-memory; it removes the need for a local blockchain client
  for local testing and provides additional tools to aid in development of smart contracts.
- Truffle: Part of Ethereum development framework which provides a compilation, testing and deployment pipeline for Dapp developers.

- MetaMask: Extension for the Chrome web browser that enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, as required for the use
  of Dapps.
- NodeJS: Provides a development framework for Truffle and enables use of NPM, the NodeJS package manager, for the installation of JavaScript dependencies
